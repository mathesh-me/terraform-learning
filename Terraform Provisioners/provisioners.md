## Provisioners

### What are Provisioners?
You can use provisioners to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine in order to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects for service.

### Provisioners are a Last Resort
Terraform includes the concept of provisioners as a measure of pragmatism, knowing that there are always certain behaviors that cannot be directly represented in Terraform's declarative model.

However, they also add a considerable amount of complexity and uncertainty to Terraform usage. Firstly, Terraform cannot model the actions of provisioners as part of a plan because they can in principle take any action. Secondly, successful use of provisioners requires coordinating many more details than Terraform usage usually requires: direct network access to your servers, issuing Terraform credentials to log in, making sure that all of the necessary external software is installed, etc.

The following sections describe some situations which can be solved with provisioners in principle, but where better solutions are also available. We do not recommend using provisioners for any of the use-cases described in the following sections.

Even if your specific use-case is not described in the following sections, we still recommend attempting to solve it using other techniques first, and use provisioners only if there is no other option.

### Types of Provisioners

#### Local-Exec Provisioner
The `local-exec` provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource.

#### Remote-Exec Provisioner
The `remote-exec` provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc.

#### File Provisioner
The `file` provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource. This is similar to the `file` provisioner in Vagrant.
